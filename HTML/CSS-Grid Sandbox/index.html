    <h1>Making responsive websites</h1>
    <p><em>Media queries</em> are a great way to ensure that all users of a website have a good experience. The media queries - literall '@media' as if it's asking the media
    a question - will ask the browser of a user about its current dimensions. The browser will tell our CSS what size it is, and the CSS will rearrange and 
    redisplay based on those parameters. My goal here is to show hot to use the queries, but all we want from you right this instant is awareness that the concept
    of media queries exists. This stuff is going on in the the background of things like Bootstrap</p>
